# UnityLab-CISC-3667
The purpose of this game is to implement the game elements discussed during in class Unity Lectures into one basic "Balloon Popping" game.

In this particular game, the player takes control of a Charizard character and tries to pop a balloon by shooting fireballs at it.

This game has the following items:

1.	layered background (background  /foreground)
2.	at least one image
3.	a player-controlled sprite
4.	an balloon sprite with automatic movement
5.	the ability for the player to shoot pins at the enemy
6.	collision detection of pins, using tags so that a player does not pop himself with his own bullets
7.	sound effect on collisions
8.	displayed score for player
9.	increasing size of balloon and impact on score
10.	at least three levels in increasing order of difficulty. Document the difficulty of each level in the directions.
11.	Fleeing algorithm implemented as one of the levels (balloon escapes player)
12.	scene transitions: Every time that your player pops the balloon, the game should transition to the next level. Every time the balloon gets too big and disappears, the current level should be restarted.
13.	directions (include the basics of each level)
14.	settings, including a volume setting with a slider
15.	menu
16.	pause/resume and link back to menu
17.	some other UI (dropdown, toggle, input)
18.	a data item that persist from scene to scene
19.	a second data item that persists
20.	high scores (at least 5, presented in order)
21.	animation #1
22.	animation #2


Note: As the purpose of this game is to implement the knowledge gained from in class lectures, this game is NOT fully polished or ready to fully ship.
